        <h2>Here to service for your enjoyment!</h2>
       <p>Our online community will help people find out their similarities and give them opportunities to find new friends.</p>
       <p class="summary"> It takes time for people to find others and figure out if they have anything in common but with this website we can help by sectioning it into categories and help people find what they like and what they dont so they have a chance to play with others more often. We also want to help find what best suits you and who would be best compatible for you to be around with.</p>
        <h2>Your perfect online community</h2>
